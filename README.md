# Project Setup Summary & Flow

This document outlines the setup and flow of a Node.js/Express backend application for user authentication and profile management, using MongoDB, JWT, Cloudinary, and Mongoose. Follow these steps to understand and rebuild the project from scratch.

---

## üî∞ 1. Project Initialization

**Purpose**: Set up the project foundation with Node.js and necessary dependencies.

- Initialize a Node.js project with `npm init -y` to create a package.json file.
- Install core dependencies: express, mongoose, dotenv, jsonwebtoken, bcrypt, cookie-parser, multer, cloudinary, mongoose-aggregate-paginate-v2.
- Install development dependencies: nodemon, prettier.
- Add scripts to package.json for starting the server in production (`start`) and development (`dev`) modes.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è 2. Project Structure

**Purpose**: Organize the codebase for modularity and maintainability.

- Create root files: app.js, index.js, .env, .env.sample.
- Create directories: config, db, models, controllers, routes, middlewares, utils.
- Structure includes:
  - config: Environment variables and constants.
  - db: MongoDB connection logic.
  - models: Mongoose schemas and models.
  - controllers: Business logic for API endpoints.
  - routes: API route definitions.
  - middlewares: Authentication, file uploads, and error handling.
  - utils: Helper functions for async handling, errors, responses, and Cloudinary.
  - app.js: Express app setup.
  - index.js: Server entry point.

## üßπ 3. Code Formatting

**Purpose**: Ensure consistent code style across the project.

- Set up Prettier with a .prettierrc file to enforce formatting rules (e.g., semicolons, single quotes).
- Create a .prettierignore file to exclude node_modules, .env, and package-lock.json.
- Run Prettier to format all files.

---

## üåê 4. Environment Configuration

**Purpose**: Store sensitive configurations securely.

- Create a .env file with variables: PORT, MONGO_URI, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET, REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET, CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME, CLOUDINARY_API_KEY, CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET, NODE_ENV.
- Create a .env.sample file as a template, excluding sensitive values.
- Load environment variables in app.js using dotenv.

---

## üîå 5. Database Setup

**Purpose**: Connect to MongoDB for data persistence.

- Create a db/index.js file to establish a MongoDB connection using Mongoose.
- Implement error handling for connection failures.
- Export the connection function and call it in index.js to initialize the database.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 6. Utilities

**Purpose**: Create reusable helper functions for error handling, responses, and Cloudinary integration.

- asyncHandler.js: Wraps async route handlers to catch and forward errors.
- apiError.js: Defines a custom error class for consistent API error responses.
- apiResponse.js: Structures success responses with status code, data, and message.
- cloudinary.js: Manages image uploads and deletions with Cloudinary.

---

## üß† 7. Models

**Purpose**: Define the user schema and methods for authentication.

- Create a user.models.js file with a Mongoose schema for user data (username, email, fullname, password, avatar, coverImage, refreshToken, watchHistory).
- Add a pre-save hook to hash passwords using bcrypt.
- Define methods: isPasswordCorrect (password verification), generateAccessToken, generateRefreshToken (JWT generation).
- Use mongoose-aggregate-paginate-v2 plugin for efficient data queries.

---

## üîí 8. Authentication Flow

**Purpose**: Implement secure JWT-based authentication.

- Registration: Validate inputs, upload images to Cloudinary, hash password, save user.
- Login: Validate credentials, verify password, generate tokens, store refresh token, set cookies.
- Protected Routes: Verify JWT using middleware, populate req.user with user data.
- Token Refresh: Validate refresh token, issue new tokens.
- Logout: Clear refresh token and cookies.

---

## üõ§Ô∏è 9. Routes and Controllers

**Purpose**: Define API endpoints and their logic.

- Routes (user.routes.js): Define endpoints using Express Router, apply Multer for file uploads, and verifyJWT for protected routes.
- Controllers (user.controller.js): Handle business logic (e.g., user registration, login, profile updates) using asyncHandler for error management.

---

## üì§ 10. File Uploads with Multer and Cloudinary

**Purpose**: Handle image uploads for user avatars and cover images.

- Create a multer.middlewares.js file to configure Multer for disk storage of uploaded files.
- Use Multer in routes to process avatar and cover image uploads.
- Upload files to Cloudinary and store their URLs in the database.

---

## üìä 11. MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines

**Purpose**: Fetch complex user data efficiently.

- Channel Profile: Use aggregation to retrieve subscriber counts and subscription status by matching username, looking up subscribers, and adding computed fields.
- Watch History: Fetch videos with owner details using nested lookups.
- Implement in controllers for channel profile and watch history endpoints.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 12. App Setup

**Purpose**: Configure the Express application and start the server.

- app.js: Set up Express, enable JSON and URL-encoded parsing, cookie-parser, and mount user routes.
- index.js: Connect to MongoDB and start the server on the specified port.

---

## üß™ 13. Testing with Postman

**Purpose**: Verify API functionality.

- Test endpoints (e.g., register, login, history) using Postman.
- Include Authorization headers with Bearer tokens for protected routes.
- Test file uploads with multipart/form-data.

---

## ‚úÖ 14. Suggestions for Improvement

- Add input validation with Joi or express-validator.
- Enhance security with helmet, cors, and rate-limit.
- Implement unit tests using Jest and Supertest.
- Add logging with winston or morgan.
- Generate API documentation with Swagger.

## üîÑ Flow Summary

1. Client sends a request to an API endpoint.
2. Routes direct the request to the appropriate controller, applying middlewares (e.g., Multer, verifyJWT).
3. Middleware processes files or authenticates the user.
4. Controller executes business logic, interacting with models.
5. Model performs database operations (e.g., save user, generate tokens).
6. Response is sent back with a structured success or error message.

This modular flow ensures scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.
